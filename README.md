# Hdmi-Audio-Fail-On-Sleep-Repairer
Do your HDMI audio devices stop showing up after your monitor comes back from sleep? Automatically disable/re-enable to fix that!

## Current Status:

Build with Visual Studio 2022 then run HdmiAudioSleepRepairer.Main.exe from the build folder. 

Currently, you can right click on the icon in the system tray and choose "Restart Device" and it should restart the device that you've configured the program to work with.

To configure which device to enable/disable/restart, right click the icon in the system tray, and choose "Open Settings" then follow the instructions there.
